## Preamble
Having woken up late today there is a lot to get done for launch day! 
Remember we officially launch at **20:00 BST** on Saturday the 20th of September 2025.

## Minecraft
As the primary owner, and maintainer of Shimincraft there a few things that I need to do prior to launch:
- Ensure the server configuration is set to as-vanilla as possible
  - Also ensuring "exploits", like TNT duping & breaking bedrock **is enabled**
- Ensure users can access all their commands and utilities
  - Such as claiming, and ensuring users can `/discord link` themselves
- Ensure the [3D Map](https://map.shimincraft.com) has rendered everything.
  - ![](/img/blog/spawn_screenshot.webp)
- Ensure the world has finished generating **and check world borders**

All of these things help ensure that the player experience is as smooth as physically possible **upon launch**. 
We do **not want** people leaving due to little bugs or the like.

## Companion Site Updates
### [Map](https://map.shimincraft.com) 
- Added a [wiki page](/docs/server-life/companion-sites/blue-map) on the map and its usage.
- Added extra features:
  - Such as "Ruler Measurement", allows you to measure the distance between two images when you click the ruler icon
  - Auto quality, attempts to change the resolution settings auto-magically in order to get a smooth experience

## Discord
Be sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vE3hm4dFxE) if you haven't done so already in order to connect with other members

The discord has been reworked a little with new roles and better permissions to hopefully make it easier for new players to understanding what is going on. 
I encourage users to check it out and [ask for help](https://discord.com/channels/820742638693122088/982284234389610496) if they have any issues with the server,
tickets allow moderators like myself to keep track of issues users have, or bugs with the server. Transcripts and reports are also available to ensure everything is closed in a timely manner.

Feel free to invite people you know who want a **new server** to play on.

Remember you can link your minecraft & discord account with `/discord link`, this (ðŸ‘€ may or may not) carry some extra perks in the future as well!

## Wiki Updates
I also continued to work on the wiki, adding some extra pages on the [map](/docs/server-life/companion-sites/blue-map) as well as our [player stats](/docs/server-life/companion-sites/player-statistics) service!
