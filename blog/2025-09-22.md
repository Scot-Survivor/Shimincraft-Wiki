## Preamble
It's been a few days since launch now, and I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the changes that have occurred since then.
The server has been holding up far better than I expected, and resource usage remains at an acceptable level.
Every player who has joined so far has been a pleasure to interact with, and I look forward to seeing how the community grows over time.

A few issues cropped on during the first few days that I wanted to address. 

## Issue 1: Rewards System
The original rewards system _drastically_ underperformed. With bugs that were not well documented and issues around our bedrock players this plugin has been removed.
**The new rewards system**, has a much nicer GUI and is far more user-friendly than the previous. You can still claim with `/rewards gui` except this time it works!

The time left to claim is also identified on the rank itself:

This should make it far easier for newer players, and current to understand their current position as well as their next goal.

## Issue 2: Land Claims
Some issues arose with land claims, firstly its obvious that 20 chunks is not enough for players to build what they want to build.
This has been increased to **50 chunks** per player, with an additional **80 support chunks** that players can donate to their Uji (land).
This should allow players to build larger bases, and communities without having to worry about running out of space.

[The claims page](/docs/server-life/functionality/claims) has been updated to reflect these changes. 

## Issue 3: Map
The map had not been updating as expecting, some minor changes should now help this, and you can view the [map page](/docs/server-life/companion-sites/blue-map) for more information.


## Closing remarks
Overall, I'm very pleased with how the server has been performing since launch. The community is friendly and welcoming, and I'm excited to see how it grows over time.
