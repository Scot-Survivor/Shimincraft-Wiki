# What is Shimincraft?
Shimincraft is a **Survival Multiplayer Server**, it uses resourcepacks in order to add custom items, such as good and "skins" to the game. \\
This allows for custom items **without** the need for mods on the client side. Further features include:
- Hermit-like
- Item Based Economy (Diamonds)
- Custom Food, Hats and **Tool Skins**

There is a [3D Map Available](https://map.shimincraft.com) that allows you to view the map (as of 2025/09 16k by 16k) this can be useful to seeing where you might want to build your base. 
In case you want to explore the map in game the seed for the world is: `9120866`.
