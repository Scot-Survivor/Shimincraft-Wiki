# Chat Formatting on Shimincraft
Chat formatting, including colors and special effects, is a perk available to players who have reached the [required rank](/docs/server-life/ranks).
This guide will help you understand how to use chat formatting effectively on Shimincraft.

## Available Formatting Options
Once you have the necessary rank, you can use the following formatting options in your chat messages:
- **Colors**: You can change the color of your text using color codes.
- **Bold**: Make your text bold.
- **Italic**: Italicize your text.
- **Underline**: Underline your text.
- **Strikethrough**: Strike through your text.
- **Magic**: Apply a "magic" effect to your text, making it appear animated

## How to Use Formatting
To use chat formatting, you will need to use specific codes before your text. Here are some examples:
- **Color Codes**: Use `&` followed by a color code (0-9, a-f) to change text color.
- **Bold**: Use `&l` before your text to make it bold.
- **Italic**: Use `&o` before your text to italicize it.
- **Underline**: Use `&n` before your text to underline it. 
- **Strikethrough**: Use `&m` before your text to strike through it. 
- **Magic**: Is a special effect, and is accessible with `&k`.
