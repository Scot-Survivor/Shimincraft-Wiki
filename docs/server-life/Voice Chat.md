# Proximity Voice Chat on Shimincraft
Shimincraft uses the [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) mod to provide proximity voice chat functionality. 
You need to download and install the mod in order to use voice chat on the server. Without it, you can still play and enjoy the server, but you won't be able to communicate with other players using voice chat.

## Installing Simple Voice Chat
1. Download the Simple Voice Chat mod from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat).
2. Make sure you have the correct version of the mod that matches your Minecraft version (1.21.8).
3. Install the mod using your preferred mod loader (e.g., Fabric or Forge).
4. Restart your Minecraft client to ensure the mod is loaded correctly.
5. Join the Shimincraft server using the IP address `mc.shimincraft.com`.
6. Once in the server, you should see a prompt to setup your voice chat, follow instructions on screen.

Refer to [Simple Voice Chat's Wiki](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/client_setup) for more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting tips.
