## What is the [Shimincraft Map](https://map.shimincraft.com)?
The "map", is a **on-demand**, **live 3D** map of the world, when players make changes to chunks or the world, the map will re-render those blocks in multiple resolutions

## Usage
### Basic Controls
by using the controls at the top of the page: ![](/img/docs/server-life/companion-sites/map/map_controls.webp) you're able to change:
- Day/Night setting
- View Mode
  - Perspective View
  - Flat View
  - Free-flight spectator mode (like Minecraft spectator)

When players are online their positions are **updated live on the map**, unless they're either crouching or invisible, such as via potion effect
### Changing World
You can change the world you're viewing to:
- Overworld
- Nether
- End

Simply by using clicking the map icon: <MapButton style={{ width: '1em', height: '1em', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} />, once you have done this you can then select the correct map:

Currently, there is only the three maps, but [when boss fights are added](/blog/welcome-to-shimincraft-wiki#boss-fights) I plan to have the arenas visible too!

## Closing remarks

Now you know everything you need to, [enjoy the map](https://map.shimincraft.com), and let me know if you have any suggestions!
