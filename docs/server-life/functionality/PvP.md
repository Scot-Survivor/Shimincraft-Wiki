PvP in Shimincraft is **opt in**, which means that all players engaging in combat **must have PvP enabled** to both deal and receive damage. 
This system is designed to ensure that players can choose whether or not they want to participate in PvP combat, providing a safer environment for those who prefer to avoid it.

Only two basic commands are needed to manage your PvP status:
- `/pvp` - Toggle your PvP status on or off.
- `/pvpstatus` - Check your current PvP status.
 
Some key things to remember about PvP on Shimincraft:
- **PvP is disabled by default** for all players when they join the server.
- **Newbie Protection**: Gives new players a period of 5 minutes after joining
  - this can be disabled with `/newbie disable` if you wish to engage in PvP sooner.
