# Land Claims on Shimincraft
In Shimincraft, land claims (Ujis) are essential for protecting your builds and resources from other players. This guide will walk you through the basics of managing your land claims using the `/lands` command.
A different and more thorough guide can be found on the [official Lands plugin documentation](https://wiki.incredibleplugins.com/lands/players/basics/start). But this guide will cover the basics.

## Key Things to Remember
As of right now you can claim a maximum of **50 chunks** across __all worlds__.
- Uji/Land
    - "Uji" is the name given to your claims, think of this like an [Uji](/glossary#uji-Ê∞è).
    - You can either have your own uji, **or** be a member of someone else's uji.
- Claiming Limits
    - Overworld: Y=30 to Y=320
    - Nether: Y=128 to Y=255 (roof to build height)
    - End: **not allowed for now**
- Earning Chunks
    - **Own Chunks**: 1 chunk (16x16 blocks) every 30 minutes of playtime, up to a maximum of 20 chunks.
    - [**Support Chunks**](/docs/server-life/claims#support-chunks): 1 chunk (16x16 blocks) every 30 minutes of playtime, up to a maximum of 80 chunks.



## Generic Intro
To get started with Uji claims, use the `/lands` command. This will open a menu with various options for managing your uji claims.
By Executing `/lands claim` it will claim an initial chunk for you, this will be your "home" chunk, and you can expand from there.
**Chunks do not need to be adjacent to each other.** If you're instead a member of an Uji, you can claim chunks for that Uji instead.

**Choose a name for your Uji**: `/lands create <name>`, if you do not choose one it'll default to your display name.

## Claiming Chunks
To claim a chunk, simply stand in the chunk you want to claim and use the `/lands claim` command. This will claim the chunk for your Uji, provided you have enough available chunks to claim it.

You can also use `/lands claim [radius, auto, fill]` to change how to claim.
- `radius <number>`: Claims a square area with the specified radius around you. For example, `/lands claim radius 2` will claim a 5x5 area (2 chunks in each direction from your current chunk).
- `auto`: Will claim chunks you walk into, until you run out of available chunks to claim.
- `fill`: Will claim all chunks that are surrounded by claimed chunks.

You can view currently claimed chunks with `/lands claimlist`.

## Claiming larger areas
You can use `/lands selection` to select a larger area to claim. This will allow you to claim multiple chunks at once, up to your maximum limit.
1. Use `/lands selection` in one corner of the area you want to claim.
2. Move to the opposite corner of the area you want to claim and use `/lands selection` again.
3. Use `/lands claim` to claim the selected area.

## Resizing and Deleting Claims
To resize a claim, use `/lands unclaim` to remove chunks from your claim. This also works with [selection](/docs/server-life/claims#claiming-larger-areas).

## Deleting an Uji
To delete your Uji and all its claims, use `/lands delete <name>`. **This action is irreversible**


# Extra Bits
Small bites of information that might be useful to know.
## Support Chunks
These are chunks that *you* as a player "give" to the Uji (land) you're a member of. As you rank up in the server,
through playtime, you'll be able to contribute more chunks to your Uji. These chunks can be used by the Uji owner to expand their uji claim.
