# What are Rewards?
Rewards are special items or perks that players can earn through various achievements, milestones, or contributions to the Shimincraft community. They serve as a recognition of a player's dedication and involvement in the server.

These are mostly given for player-time, but may also be awarded for special events, contests, or exceptional contributions to the community.

# Types of Rewards
Rewards can come in various forms, including but not limited to:
- **Rank Item Wraps**: Special skins for tools and weapons that can be obtained by reaching certain ranks.
- **Exclusive Wraps**: Unique item skins that are awarded for special events or contributions.
- **Rank Perks**: Additional features or commands that come with certain ranks. See [Ranks](/docs/server-life/ranks) for more information.
- **Custom Titles**: Unique titles that can be displayed alongside a player's name in chat.
