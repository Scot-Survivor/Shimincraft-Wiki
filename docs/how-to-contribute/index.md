# How to Contribute
Welcome to the Shimincraft Wiki! We're excited to have you here and appreciate your interest in contributing to our community. This guide will help you get started with contributing to the Shimincraft Wiki.


To contribute, you'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
You will also need a basic understanding of Git and Markdown. If you're new to these tools, there are plenty of resources available online to help you get started.
You can download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine, and you can use any text editor or IDE that supports Markdown (such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).


This wiki is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator that makes it easy to create and maintain documentation websites. If you're interested in learning more about Docusaurus, you can check out their [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

## Getting Started
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the Shimincraft Wiki repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the original.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Next, clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Scot-Survivor/Shimincraft-Wiki.git
    ```
3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. This helps keep your changes organized and makes it easier to manage multiple contributions. You can create a new branch with the following command:
    ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
4. **Make Your Changes**: Now you're ready to make changes! You can edit existing pages or add new ones. The wiki uses Markdown for formatting, so if you're not familiar with it, you might want to check out a [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
5. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you've made your changes, commit them to your branch with a descriptive message. Use the following commands:
   ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
    ```
6. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command:
   ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
7. **Create a Pull Request**: Finally, go to the original Shimincraft Wiki repository and create a pull request from your forked repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you've made and why they should be merged.

## Guidelines for Contributions
- **Be Respectful**: Always be respectful and considerate when interacting with other contributors. We're a community, and we want to maintain a positive and welcoming environment.
- **Stay on Topic**: Ensure that your contributions are relevant to the Shimincraft Wiki and its content.
- **Cite Sources**: If you're adding information from external sources, please provide proper citations to give credit where it's due.
- **Follow Formatting Standards**: Adhere to the existing formatting and style guidelines used in the wiki to maintain consistency.
- **Review Before Submitting**: Before submitting your pull request, review your changes to ensure accuracy and clarity.
